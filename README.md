# Helios Election System with mixnet support

Helios is an end-to-end verifiable voting system.

This is a fork of [Ben Adida's Helios server](https://github.com/benadida/helios-server), with support for mixnets using code pulled in from [Zeus](https://github.com/grnet/zeus), but without the other changes made in Zeus, and with some other minor changes.

## Features

* This fork produces a tally of the ballots cast, like Zeus. This allows it to be used in voting systems other than approval voting (which is supported by Helios), since the vote tally can be fed to any other system that actually produces the election results.
  * A drag-and-drop interface for STV is implemented, and a standalone counter.
* Optional reddit authentication support.
* Improved support for password authentication.
* Group voting ticket support.
  * Input candidates using the format `Name/Party/1`, where the candidates are sorted within the GVT by the number (can be a decimal).

### A word on security

This implementation produces 80 shadow mixes for each shuffling proof, in accordance with the [original Helios paper](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec08/tech/full_papers/adida/adida.pdf). This is less than its inspiration, [Josh Benaloh's paper](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/evt06/tech/full_papers/benaloh/benaloh.pdf) (which recommends 100), and Zeus (which uses 128 by default). You may want to increase `CUSTOM_SHUFFLING_PROOF_SECURITY_PARAMETER` in *phoebus/mixnet/params.py* for increased security.
